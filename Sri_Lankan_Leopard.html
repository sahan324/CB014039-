        <h2><span>Sri </span>Lankan <span>Leopards</span></h2>
        <p>Known as the ‚ÄòLord of the Jungle‚Äô, the Sri Lankan Leopard (Panthera parades kotiya) is one of the eight recognized subspecies of Leopard and is indigenous to Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan Leopard, the smallest of the ‚ÄòBig cats‚Äô is still the only large mammal predator in the country and relatively bigger in size than its relatives living elsewhere. It is rusty yellow coloured with its characteristic dark spots and lithe elongated bodies. It is stocky in build, with a shoulder height of about 45 to 80 centimeters with males weighing around 56 kg and females around 29 kg and lives up o 20 years. They are highly graceful and agile animals are predatory carnivores making them excellent hunters who pursue different prey such as small mammals, birds, reptiles, wild boar, sambur and barking-deer of which the spotted deer makes a larger part of its diet. They hunt mainly during the nights and are best observed during dawn and dusk and sometimes during the daytime as well.</p>

          <h2>Threats and Conservation</h2>
          <br>
          <p>The Sri Lankan Leopard is rapidly declining due to habitat loss and fragmentation, and hunting for trade and due to pest control.
          Skins and canines are widely traded in Sri Lanka, as the canine is worn as a talisman by some village folks as it is said to bring about good fortune, while certain parts of the animal is eaten or applied to traditional medicine.
          On a global context the leopard is classified as Near Threatened by the IUCN and is listed on CITES (Convention in the Trade in Endangered Species): Appendix I. the Sri Lankan Leopard is classified as Endangered due to habitat loss and poaching.
          There are records of over six specimens of leopards being poached in areas around national parks.
          Sri Lanka has one record of a man eater, the man eater of Punanai, which has been accredited for killing nearly 15 individuals, before finally being laid to rest by Edgar, who killed the animal by waiting in ambush.
          This is documented in Christopher Ondaatje‚Äôs award winning tale ‚ÄòThe Man-Eater of Punanai‚Äô.</p>
