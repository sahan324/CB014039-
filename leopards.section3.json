    "explanation": "The misty highlands of Sri Lanka is hardly a place one would imagine encountering a leopard. But despite this, historically, the highlands are where most of the island forests are covered, it was and where most of the wildlife animals roamed. With the onset of the British taking over the country, they cleared these vast forests to grow Coffee and subsequently Tea. One of the last remaining highland wilderness refuges is Horton Plains, National Park. Located over 2500 meters above sea level, this montane wilderness is set atop a high plateau and is one of Mother Natureâ€™s most spectacular wonders."
