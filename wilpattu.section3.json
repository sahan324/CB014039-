      "description": "Wilpattu is a year-round destination and a great place to explore at any time. However, the best time to visit Wilpattu National Park is from May until early October. This is the dry season in northwestern Sri Lanka, which creates perfect conditions for spotting animals. During these months, the animals tend to gather around the park’s many natural lakes and other watering holes making them easier to spot. Additionally, given the lack of rainfall during these months, the vegetation is less dense making it easier to see animals from further away. May–July is the best time to see Sri Lankan sloth bears in Wilpattu. These are the months when the park’s palu trees produce their fruit, which is the bears’ favorite food. If you visit during the wet season (late October–February), you should be prepared for some heavy rain. Some of the park’s roads and tracks can become impassable, which can restrict the areas that you’re able to visit. That said, these are the best months to visit Wilpattu for birdwatching. Many species of migratory birds flock here from all over Europe and Northern Asia to escape the cold winter, including pintails, plovers, sandpipers, and terns."
