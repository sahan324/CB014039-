    "explanation": "The Sri Lankan Leopard is rapidly declining due to habitat loss and fragmentation, and hunting for trade and due to pest control. Skins and canines are widely traded in Sri Lanka, as the canine is worn as a talisman by some village folks as it is said to bring about good fortune, while certain parts of the animal is eaten or applied to traditional medicine. On a global context the leopard is classified as Near Threatened by the IUCN and is listed on CITES (Convention in the Trade in Endangered Species): Appendix I. the Sri Lankan Leopard is classified as Endangered due to habitat loss and poaching. There are records of over six specimens of leopards being poached in areas around national parks. Sri Lanka has one record of a man eater, the man eater of Punanai, which has been accredited for killing nearly 15 individuals, before finally being laid to rest by Edgar, who killed the animal by waiting in ambush. This is documented in Christopher Ondaatje’s award winning tale ‘The Man-Eater of Punanai’."
