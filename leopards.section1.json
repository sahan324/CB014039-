    "explanation": "Kumana National Park is located in the Eastern part of Yala National park and holds its own as a bird sanctuary while also being home to some of the larger mammals found in Yala west park. Kumana has its large estuary called 'Kumbukkan Oya'. These estuary mangroves are largely used by migratory and resident birds to build nests and raise their young.\n\nSightings of changeable hawk eagles, painted and rare black-necked storks, egrets, godwits, ibis, and many more are possible by the many lagoons. When you are on a wildlife safari in Kumana National Park, watch out for elephants, spotted, and sambar deer, and of course, the magnificent leopard. You will have to have keen eyes to spot the leopards lying in the undergrowth of the forest. They too are quite active around watering holes like the Kumana Villu swamp. Sometimes if you are lucky, you will find one or two leopards cross the roads in front of your safari jeeps as they hunt for their next meal."
